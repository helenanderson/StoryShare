				<p><big>Omosola is our Studio-leader TA. She's also universally considered the best, brightest, most beautiful studio leader there is. She's objectively better than the others- even middle-aged Graham Roth. Legends tell us that she single handedly slew a horde of dragons that were threatening to take over London. She then discovered the theory of relativety and built the pyramids. Since coming to Stanford she has graciously decided to bless her sectionees with her devoted attention and unparalleled teaching ability. She's such a good teacher that all her sectionees end up getting an A. Just to reiterate- Omosola is the best.</big></p>
