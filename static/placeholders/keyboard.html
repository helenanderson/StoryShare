<!-- I don't know how to make a keyboard pop-up when we need it, so I just made a button that takes you here.
I think it would take a fair amount javascript to make it happen, so it's outside the scope of this week's
assignment. I also like the idea of having a button that the client needs to click in order to add to the story.
