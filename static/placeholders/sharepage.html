<!-- This page is a placeholder for the share page. It occurs to me now that we might have a problem with having
a share function in the menu. Firstly, how do we know what story the client wants to share? If we do this we would need ot have the share option on the story itself. But that said, I don't really like the idea of a random button either. I did realize that we need a back button from the menu, so maybe instead of including the share button on the menu we would use a back button! That seems like a good idea to me!-->
